# Explore manifold learning
The objective of this notebook is to investigate various manifold learning techniques on the CIFAR-10 dataset. These techniques serve as approaches to dimensionality reduction, facilitating the visualization of high-dimensional datasets in more interpretable dimensions, such as 2D. For each technique, the CIFAR-10 dataset will be projected into 2D space, with data points colored according to their class.

This notebook will cover the following manifold learning algorithms:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Isomap Embedding
Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)
Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)
Spectral Embedding
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
